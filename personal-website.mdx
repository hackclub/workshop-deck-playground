# What is HTML?

<Notes>

IDK, you tell me

</Notes>

---

# HTML is made up of `<tags>`

Thereâ€™s a tag for every common element on a webpage: headings, text, buttons, form inputs

---

# Each tag has an opening & closing tag

`<h1>` opens a heading, `</h1>` closes it. The content of the heading goes in between the opening and closing tags.

```html
<h1>This is a heading!</h1>
```

---

# Write your own heading!

<Editor checks={["<h1>", "</h1>"]}>


Add your name between opening and closing heading tags

</Editor>


---

# Congrats! You've written your first line of HTML.

Your personal website is merely a collection of a few different types of HTML tags, not much different from what you just wrote. Ready to start building it?

Repl.it gives us some code to start, but we're going to start from scratch. Delete everything in the `index.html` file.

## Everything in an HTML file goes between opening and closing `<html>` tags.

```html
<html>
  <!-- content -->
</html>
```

---

## An HTML file typically contains a `<head>` and a `<body>`

```html
<html>
  <head>
    
  </head>
  <body>
   
  </body>
</html>
```

The body holds everything you see on your website, while the head conveys information about the page to the browser.

---

At the top of every HTML page, you'll find something along the lines of `<!DOCTYPE html>`. This tells the browser what version of HTML to expect. Since it is a language, HTML is constantly growing and updating, so there are multiple versions. In our case, we are going to use HTML5, the latest version.

---

<Horizontal>

Start by adding `<!DOCTYPE html>` to the top of the `index.html` file of your repl.it project.

![doctype html](https://cloud-4u72bs5d5.vercel.app/screen_shot_2020-09-04_at_12.49.35_pm.png)

</Horizontal>

---

Then, just under it, add the `<head>` and `<body>` tags.

![website skeleton tags](https://cloud-h7m2airqr.vercel.app/screen_shot_2020-09-04_at_12.50.01_pm.png)

</Horizontal>

---

Cool! Now that you've populated your website with the necessary tags it needs to run, it's time to add some content ðŸŽ‰

---

<Flex sx={{ flexDirection: 'column' }}>

Remember the `<h1>` tag you wrote earlier? Let's write another one, in between the `<body>` tags.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    
  </head>
  <body>
   <h1>Prophet Orpheus</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

</Flex>

---

<Flex sx={{ flexDirection: 'column' }}>

To give a description of Orpheus, we want to use the `<p>`, or "paragraph" tag.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    
  </head>
  <body>
   <h1>Prophet Orpheus</h1>
   <p>Coder Dino</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

</Flex>

---

<Horizontal>

To see what your website looks like so far, click the green "Run" button at the top of the code editor.

---

<Flex sx={{ flexDirection: 'column' }}>

You can even add a second `<p>` tag to further describe Orpheus!

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    
  </head>
  <body>
   <h1>Prophet Orpheus</h1>
   <p>Coder Dino</p>
   <p>Will code for food</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

</Flex>

---

<Horizontal>

If you click the "Run" button again, you should see it update!

---

We should probably add an image of Orpheus too.

---

# The `img` tag

```html
<img src="link-to-raw-image">
```

---

<Horizontal>

<Flex sx={{ flexDirection: 'column', px: '10px', textAlign: 'left' }}>

```html
<img src="link-to-raw-image">
```

1. `src` is an [attribute](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_attributes.asp)
2. Because the image tag doesn't require any contents like `<h1>` and `<p>` do, you don't need a closing tag
3. The link to the image must be a direct link to an image.

</Flex>

# Adding CSS

---

CSS is used to add styling to your HTML. Here's an example of what CSS looks like:

```css
h1 {
  color: green;
}
```

This piece of CSS finds all `<h1>` tags in your HTML file and changes the text in all of them to green.

---

Orpheus's image is a little too big, don't you think? Let's use CSS to resize it.

---

<Grid columns={[null,null,2]} sx={{ px: [3, 4, 5], minHeight:'100vh', alignItems: 'center' }}>

  Start by navigating to the `style.css` file at the left of your repl.it project.

  ![style.css](https://cloud-qvrqeuzut.vercel.app/screen_shot_2020-09-04_at_2.19.37_pm.png)

</Grid>

---

<Grid columns={[null,null,2]} sx={{ px: [3, 4, 5], minHeight:'100vh', alignItems: 'center' }}>

Start by selecting the image tag, followed by opening and closing curly braces:

```css
img {

}
```

</Grid>

---

<Grid columns={[null,null,2]} sx={{ px: [3, 4, 5], minHeight:'10vh', alignItems: 'center' }}>

  And set the width to 200px. (Don't forget the semicolon at the end!)

  ```css
  img {
    width: 200px;
  }
  ```

</Grid>

#### `px`, or "pixels", are a unit of measurement in CSS. [Learn more about CSS units here!](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_units.asp)

---

<Grid columns={[null, null, 2]} sx={{ px: [3, 4, 5], minHeight:'10vh', alignItems: 'center' }}>

If you run your repl, you should see that Orpheus is still big! :( Why do you think this is happening?

  ![big orpheus even though we wrote css](https://cloud-fpzzhfcof.vercel.app/screen_shot_2020-09-04_at_2.39.25_pm.png)

</Grid>

---

Right now, the HTML file doesn't know the CSS file exists, so nothing we put in the CSS file will have an effect on our HTML. To fix this, we need to **link the HTML file to the CSS file**.

---

<Flex sx={{ flexDirection: 'column' }}>

  Navigate back to your `index.html` file. Inside the `<head>`, add:

  ```html
      <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />
  ```

  The `<link>` tag contains 2 attributes. `rel` indicates that we're linking a stylesheet, and `href` indicates the source of the file that we're linking.

  `<link>` is a self-closing tag, as indicated by the `/>` at the end.

</Flex>

---

<Flex sx={{ flexDirection: 'column' }}>

  ```html
    <head>
      <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />
    </head>
  ```

</Flex>

---

<Grid columns={[null, null, 2]} sx={{ px: [3, 4, 5], minHeight:'10vh', alignItems: 'center' }}>

  If you click "Run" again, you should notice that Orpheus is a much more reasonable size now!

  ![Orpheus is smaller now](https://cloud-rn81goel5.vercel.app/screen_shot_2020-09-04_at_3.00.11_pm.png)

</Grid>

---

# What other styling changes can you think of?

---

<Grid columns={[null, null, 2]} sx={{ px: [3, 4, 5], minHeight:'10vh', alignItems: 'center' }}>

Why don't we center the content on the page?

```css
body {
  text-align: center;
}
```

</Grid>

---

<Grid columns={[null, null, 2]} sx={{ px: [3, 4, 5], minHeight:'10vh', alignItems: 'center' }}>

  And while we're at it, why don't we also change the font to something nicer than Times New Roman?

```css
body {
  text-align: center;
  font-family: 'Arial';
}
```

</Grid>

---

![Content is now centered and the font is Arial](https://cloud-ma6qdfqnv.vercel.app/screen_shot_2020-09-04_at_3.09.57_pm.png)

---

Much better! But it still looks a little bland. Let's add a little bit of color!

---

<Flex sx={{ flexDirection: 'column' }}>

A good way to introduce color to your website is changing the background color and/or the color of the text. Here's an example:

```css
body {
  text-align: center;
  font-family: 'Arial';
  background: azure;
  color: purple;
}
```

`background` sets the background color of the website, and `color` sets the color of all the text on the website.

</Flex>

---

<Grid columns={[null, null, 2]} sx={{ px: [3, 4, 5], minHeight:'10vh', alignItems: 'center' }}>

Here's what this particular example looks like: 

![Styled website](https://cloud-beo9jhgnv.vercel.app/screen_shot_2020-09-04_at_3.23.36_pm.png)

</Grid>

Great work! You just made your first website!!! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

Your journey is not over yet, though. It's time to hack!

---

# Some things you can do to make your website better

<Steps>

1. If your website says "Prophet Orpheus", the first thing you should do is make it your own! Change the image and all the content to be about you or something you like.

2. Change the colors to something you like! [Here are all of the CSS colors](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors.asp), or you can google "hex color picker" and provide [hexademical color values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors).

3. Deviate from the image/title/description format and do something wacky

</Steps>
